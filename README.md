# Front-end recruitment challenge: Activity

*Please don't spend more than 2 hours on your submission.*

The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate how you:

  - write and structure a simple web application,
  - present simple data for interpretation by a human.

Feel free to use any libraries, frameworks or dependencies you want in order
to achieve the task.

Include instructions for how to build and run your code, any tests you've
written and some text explaining what you did.

## Scenario

A hospital is running a trial to see if their patients age 20-40 are falling
below the recommended level of activity:

- 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity, or
- 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity, or
- a proportionate mix of both, e.g. 25 minutes of vigorous and 100 minutes of
moderate.

## Data

Included in `/mock-api-data` are fixtures from an API that provides activity
data for participants in the trial. A single day's data is provided.

- `/definitions/activities` - defines activities and their intensity.
- `/patients` - defines all patients on the trial.
- `/patients/:id/summary` - summarises activity for a particular patient.

Dates are supplied in UTC in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

## Challenge

Present the data in a way of your choosing. Consider including some interactive
elements (e.g. sorting, filtering) and what would be relevant in the given
scenario (e.g. which patients fell below the recommended level of physical
activity?).

# Alternatively

Submit a sample from your portfolio that demonstrates how you:
- write and structure a web application,
- present data for interpretation by a human.

Include instructions for how to build and run your code, any tests you've
written and some text explaining what you did.
